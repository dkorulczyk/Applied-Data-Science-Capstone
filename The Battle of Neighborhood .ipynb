Introduction:\n    \nThe purpose of this project is to help people in exploring housing options in close neighborhood of hockey arena in Toronto.\n\nVast majority of families in Toronto have children who practice professional hokey. In a busy and traffic-congested city like Toronto, it is important to have a good connection with hokey arena to save time for traveling between home and practice numerous times a week. Having a hockey arena in a close neighborhood provides opportunity for families with college or professional players to save time and money.\n\nThis project will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city or relocating to a new neighborhood, knowing that it meets their requirement. \n\n## 2. Data Section\n\nFundamental data for the project consisting of Postal Code, Borough, and Neighborhood will be scrapped from wikipedia.\n\nData Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\nWill use Toronto dataset which we scrapped from wikipedia on Week 3. Dataset consisting of latitude and longitude, zip codes.\n\nFoursquare API Data:\n\nThe cleansed data will then be used alongside Foursquare data, which is readily available. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nFoursquare location data will be leveraged to compare neighborhoods in Toronto with close access to hockey area."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 3. Methodology\n\nData Analysis and Location Data:\n\nFoursquare location data will be leveraged to explore or compare districts around Paris.\nData manipulation and analysis to derive subsets of the initial data.\nIdentifying the high traffic areas using data visualisation and tatistical nalysis.\n\nVisualization:\n\nAnalysis and plotting visualizations.\nData visualization using various mapping libraries.\n\nClustering Approach:\n\nTo compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
