Introduction: Business Problem\n\n#### Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n    \nThe purpose of this project is to help people in exploring housing options in close neighborhood of hockey arena in Toronto.\n\nVast majority of families in Toronto have children who practice professional hokey. In a busy and traffic-congested city like Toronto, it is important to have a good connection with hokey arena to save time for traveling between home and practice numerous times a week. Having a hockey arena in a close neighborhood provides opportunity for families with college or professional players to save time and money.\n\nThis project will help people to get awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city or relocating to a new neighborhood, knowing that it meets their requirement. \n\n## 2. Data Section\n\n#### Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.\n\nFundamental data for the project consisting of Postal Code, Borough, and Neighborhood will be scrapped from wikipedia.\n\nData Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\nWill use Toronto dataset which we scrapped from wikipedia on Week 3. Dataset consisting of latitude and longitude, zip codes.\n\nFoursquare API Data:\n\nThe cleansed data will then be used alongside Foursquare data, which is readily available. Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all manner of venues and events within an area of interest. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. As such, the foursquare location platform will be used as the sole data source since all the stated required information can be obtained through the API.\n\nFoursquare location data will be leveraged to compare neighborhoods in Toronto with close access to hockey area."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 3. Methodology\n\n#### Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, and what machine learnings were used and why.\n\n\nData Analysis and Location Data:\n\nFoursquare location data will be leveraged to explore or compare districts around Paris.\nData manipulation and analysis to derive subsets of the initial data.\nIdentifying the high traffic areas using data visualisation and tatistical nalysis.\n\nVisualization:\n\nAnalysis and plotting visualizations.\nData visualization using various mapping libraries.\n\nClustering Approach:\n\nTo compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 4. Results\n\n#### Results section where you discuss the results.\n\nComparing the maps we can notice the neigborhoods in Toronto which are close to hockey arena are Victoria Village and Humewood-Cedarvale lockated on the north side of the city.  Also, the areas with a dense population don't reflect on the number of restaurants.\n\nRecommended zones should therefore be considered only as a starting point for more detailed analysis which could eventually result in location which has not only no nearby competition but also other factors taken into account and all other relevant conditions met.\n\n\n## 5. Discussion\n\n#### Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.\n\nResults of the project shows clearly that the neighborhoods with the close coonection to the hockey arenas are located on the suberbs of the city of Toronto. It might be assisiated with the high trafffic demands during sport events. The suburb home location are more popular among families, thus the requirement for hockey facilities might be linked to the advantage of living away from the downtown. \n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\n#### Conclusion section where you conclude the report.\n\nPurpose of this project was to identify Toronto neighborhoods close to hockey arena for people who are connected to the intense schedule of practicing. By calculating hockey arenas in the city this reports aims to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new home. \n\nClustering of those locations was then performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) and addresses of those zone centers were created to be used as starting points for final exploration by stakeholders.\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
